# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo. This file is loaded every session, so it's kept
lean: terse pointers here, deep reference in `docs/` (read those only when working in that area).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # Type-check (tsc -b) then bundle to ./dist
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npm run preview   # Serve ./dist locally
npm test          # Run Vitest unit tests (src/**/*.test.ts)
```

`npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` are all required to merge into `main`
(`deploy.yml` gates on lint → test → build). Run all three before considering a change finished.

## Testing

Vitest covers the pure point/streak/badge logic: `src/state/points.ts` (award/forgiveness/exact-undo
arithmetic), `src/state/defaultState.ts` (`applyDayRollover`, `backfillStreaksFromLogs`),
`src/state/badges.ts` (`findNewlyEarnedBadges` and friends), and `src/state/auth.ts`
(`normalizeHouseholdStatus`). Colocated `*.test.ts` files live next to the module they test. There
is no component/UI test setup — `verify_gravy.mjs` at the repo root is an ad-hoc Playwright
smoke-test (not wired into `npm`) that drives the app in a headless browser against a running
`npm run dev`; run it manually with `node verify_gravy.mjs` if you need a scripted UI walkthrough.

See `BACKLOG.md` for the living backlog of **open** items (security, infra, accessibility, process
gaps) — check it before assuming a known gap (e.g. plaintext PIN storage) is unintentional or
unreported. Completed/decided items are condensed to one-liners in `BACKLOG_DONE.md` (the decision
record — the "why" behind shipped work); epic numbers are stable across both files, so `BACKLOG.md`
has numbering gaps where fully-done epics live only in `BACKLOG_DONE.md`.

## Keeping tests and docs in sync

- **New/changed logic in `src/state/*.ts`** (points, streaks, badges, day rollover, any pure state
  logic) needs matching coverage in its colocated `*.test.ts`. If the logic is still tangled inside a
  `GravyContext` action hook (side effects mixed with arithmetic), extract the pure part into
  `src/state/*.ts` first, the way `points.ts` was pulled out — that's the established pattern.
- **Architecture or behavior changes** (new screens, shared/per-profile fields, panels, data flow)
  need the relevant pointer in this file **and** the matching `docs/` file updated in the same
  change — both are read to understand the system, so stale text misleads future work.
- **Closing/opening a tracked gap** needs the backlog updated: a done/decided item **moves out of
  `BACKLOG.md` into `BACKLOG_DONE.md` as a one-liner** (what + outcome + key file/PR/migration, under
  the same epic heading); a new gap gets an entry in `BACKLOG.md`, following the existing format.

## Architecture

Gravy is a gamified chores + nutrition + rewards PWA for kids: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite,
client-side-only SPA (no server/API). Data persists to `localStorage` with optional Supabase cloud
sync. Entry point: `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` → `src/App.tsx`. There is no router — every screen
beyond `HomeScreen` is an overlay drawer/modal toggled by boolean state in `AppShell`.

All state flows through one React Context (`src/state/GravyContext.tsx`), consumed via `useGravy()`.
It owns the multi-profile `GravyRoot`, the active profile's `GravyState`, local persistence/theme/
day-rollover effects, toasts/celebrations, and badge detection. The cloud-sync + parent-account
reactive layer (household code/status, Supabase realtime push/subscribe, auth tracking) lives in its
own `src/state/useHouseholdSync.ts` hook. The provider's imperative actions are split into
per-domain custom hooks under `src/state/actions/` (kid-progress, day-edit, rewards, catalog,
profile, household); the pure point arithmetic lives in `src/state/points.ts`. Persisted shapes are
in `src/state/types.ts`.

## Subsystem pointers

Deep detail lives in `docs/`. Read the linked file when working in that area.

- **State model** (`docs/state-model.md`) — `GravyContext` global state and the
  `src/state/actions/` hook layout; multi-kid Profiles (shared vs per-kid fields,
  `mirrorSharedFields`, `switchProfile`/`addProfile`); Key State Concepts (goals: daily/bonus/
  multi-step; the four streaks; `applyDayRollover`; counters; pending rewards; past-day editing via
  `*ForDay` actions + `dayLogs`; read-only kid history view via `viewedDate`/`CalendarGrid`).
- **Persistence & sync** (`docs/persistence-and-sync.md`) — `localStorage` (`STORAGE_KEY`
  `gravy_v1`); Supabase `households`/`household_members` tables; `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs +
  rate-limiting in `supabase/migrations/`; Epic 8 ownership/claim model; `safe*` storage wrappers;
  Parent Accounts (`src/state/auth.ts`) and the salted-SHA-256 PIN (`src/state/hash.ts`,
  `src/state/pinLockout.ts`).
- **UI surfaces** (`docs/ui-surfaces.md`) — kid view + `AccountMenu` (the single `grownUpUnlocked`
  lock gating Profiles/Grown ups/Log/Advanced Settings); `ParentDashboard` two-level router and its
  panels (`ApprovalsPanel`/`GoalsPanel`/`CalendarPanel`/`StorePanel`/`BadgesPanel`/`AuditLogPanel`,
  plus `SettingsPanel` reached via `AdvancedSettingsDrawer`); `Onboarding` phase machine.
- **Subsystems** (`docs/systems.md`) — Games hub (`src/data/games.ts`, `completeGameRound`,
  `DAILY_GAME_WIN_CAP`); Rank ladder (`src/data/ranks.ts`, `getRank`, `useTodaySnapshot`); 71 Badges
  (`src/data/badges.ts`, `src/state/badges.ts`, `badgeConfig`); Icon system (`src/data/icons.ts`,
  `AppIcon`); Theming (`Settings.theme`, `src/index.css`); Time zone (`Settings.timezone`,
  `todayStr`, `src/data/timezones.ts`); Deployment (`deploy.yml`); Version display
  (`__APP_VERSION__`); PWA update (`UpdatePrompt.tsx`, `vite-plugin-pwa`).

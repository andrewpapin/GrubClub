-- Epic 8 follow-up — Account-Mandatory Household Model. See BACKLOG_DONE.md Epic 8 for the
-- original claim/ownership model this tightens.
--
-- The previous migration (20260627000000_auth_household_ownership.sql) deliberately kept
-- "unclaimed" households working anonymously — a claim-or-deprecate transition window for
-- pre-account data. That window is over: the app now requires every parent to have an account
-- before it will create or join a household on their behalf, so unclaimed households can no
-- longer be created going forward. This migration:
--
--   * Requires auth.uid() to create a household (gravy_create_household, and the
--     first-write/insert branch of gravy_upsert_household_state) — no more anon-created,
--     forever-unclaimed rows.
--   * Requires membership to rename, and ownership to delete — no more "anyone with the code"
--     branch for those actions, since every household is now claimed at creation.
--   * Deliberately LEAVES gravy_upsert_household_state's existing-row branch open to anonymous
--     callers holding a valid household code. This is what lets a kid's device sync progress
--     (goal checkboxes, food log, etc.) without ever having a parent account — the app's UI
--     never lets such a device reach settings/parental-control screens, so the RPC only needs
--     to guard the household-code boundary, not the shape of the write. A signed-in caller who
--     is NOT a member is still rejected, unchanged from before.
--   * gravy_lookup_household, gravy_household_status and gravy_claim_household are unchanged —
--     the first already links a signed-in caller as a member on lookup (the mechanism both the
--     "existing parent, second device" and "co-parent" onboarding paths reuse), the second is a
--     read-only status check, and the third becomes a dead-code safety valve now that every
--     household is claimed at creation, but stays in place at no cost.
--
-- No grant/revoke changes: anon still needs EXECUTE on the tightened functions so a rejected
-- anonymous call surfaces as a readable Postgres exception (res.error) rather than a bare
-- permission-denied from PostgREST.
